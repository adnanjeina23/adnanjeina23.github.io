          <h1>The Essay</h1>
           <p>Astoria, Queens is one of the nicest neighborhoods I believe there is in the five boroughs. One of the things that makes up this beautiful neighborhood was Astoria Park, right by the side of the East River, where you can sit on the old Hell Gate Bridge and encounter these views. Astoria Park was created in the year of 1913 to serve the community with its athletics field, tennis courts, basketball courts, and huge swimming pool that was once used for Olympic diving trials in the past. The creator of this beautiful hat was once called a village was Stephen Hasley, and he named it after his friend who was a fur merchant named John Jacob Astor. Even though this village was named after him, Astor never really visited the place.</p>
           <p>Throughout all of the seasons and all kinds of temperatures, this park will always be filled with people either playing soccer on a cold winter day or laying on the nice hill having a picnic on a hot summer day. Speaking about summer, the Astoria Park Carnival is the event that everybody in Astoria attends in the three days of July that is held in. At this carnival, you can see everybody from the person you played pickup basketball with, to your barber, and even your aunt.</p>
           <p>As you walk past the many police cars and barriers due to the many fights that have occurred at this event, you are blasted with the smell of Greek souvlaki sticks, the smell of change because there are moms and dads gambling on the coin machine and the loud noise of people screaming as they are on the rides, especially Dream Chaser. Parents are holding Hennessy bottles while watching their kids go on the fun rides that they paid 60 dollars for. A ride that goes for about 25 seconds like the Alien Invasion costs six tickets which is like eight dollars.</p>
           <p>So, yea just like most things in NYC the prices for these rides are absolutely insane. Speaking about like things in NYC, this place is crowded and when I say crowded I mean that you are shoulder to shoulder with everybody and you want to make sure you don’t bump someone too hard by accident because NY’ers are really harsh and will take the time out of their day to fight you on the spot. As you tussle your way through to get to the food booths you find yourself in a line of about 100 people. Imagine  100 people waiting in line for overpriced chicken tenders and fries. After you wait in the one hour line and pay $20 for your food you need something sweet and wait for another hour for expensive fried Oreos just to later wait on another line for a ride and just throw up all the food you just paid for. However, reading this you might be saying, “Eww” this place sounds scary and disgusting, and yeah you're a little right but that is the beauty of it. Places like these will only be good for the real New Yorkers who are used to these things. So, if you’re a couple who just moved to NY you might think this will be a nice date spot, but believe me, it isn’t because you will probably find an alcoholic beverage in your Ferris wheel cart.</p>
           <p>Now, my friends and I have been going to this carnival for a long time and for the past three years my friend Aidan has always tried this challenge to eat chicken tenders with fries, then funnel cake, and a whole milkshake then to go on ALIEN INVASION. This ride doesn’t look that bad but it will seriously mess with your body. So, Aidan has never successfully done this without throwing up after, and since we go all of the days we dedicate one day to just this cause waiting on all of those lines takes up most of the night. Aidan finished with all of that delicious food and was nearing the ride as we just waited 45 minutes for this ride. We get inside the “spaceship” and there are about 25 spots and you buckle yourself in then just lean back. This ship moves so fast that you are not able to lift your head up because of the force it is giving. After about two long minutes of spinning the lights turn on and we see Aidan throw up all over his shirt. My friends and I all just laughed but then a lot of people did get angry at us because they had to close the ride to clean it up. Imagine waiting 45 mins just to get to the front and for them to close it because of a kid throwing up to a challenge. That is just hilarious!</p>
           <p>Carnivals are amazing, but carnivals in the best area in NYC, Astoria just can not be topped. Entertainment, food, and just regular NY people having a great time on a summer night.</p>
